This is my study project from Maximilian Schwarzmueller's course on React and Redux.
This is a second stable version, though I am still working on enhancements.
Some future plans include adding authentication and introducing automated testing.

The app is a burger constructor where user can pick ingredients for a burger
and then fill out a delivery form to order it. It is a SPA with routing,
consists of the main page, checkout form and order history.
Firebase is used as backend database.
The app is fully adaptive and supports all living browsers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In my code, I mostly followed the instructor, though the styling (CSS Modules)
and some component implementations (e.g. form validation) are done differently.
