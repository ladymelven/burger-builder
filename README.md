This is my study project from Maximilian Schwarzmueller's course on React and Redux. This is a second stable version, though I am still working on enhencements. Some future plans include expanding usage of Redux in the project and adding authentication.

The app is a burger contructor where user can pick ingredients for a burger and then fill out a dilvery form to order it. It is a SPA with routing, consists of the main page, checkout form and order history. Firebase is used as backend database. The app is fully adaptive and supports all living browsers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In my code, I mostly followed the instructor, though the styling (CSS Modules) and some component implementations (e.g. form validation) are done differently.
