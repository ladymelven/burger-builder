This is my study project from Maximilian Schwarzmueller's course on React/Redux stack.
This is a second stable version, it allows the user to construct a burger using four ingredients, 
then proceed to fill out a delivery form (requires authentication for that). 
The app doesn't check if the email address is real, so just feel free to type in anything =)
Once logged in, "order history" is also available.

It is a React-based SPA with routing and authentication,
consists of the main page, checkout form and order history.
Firebase is used as backend database.
The app is fully adaptive and supports all living browsers.

In my code, I mostly followed the instructor, though the styling (CSS Modules used here)
and some component implementations (e.g. form validation) are done differently.

To start up, clone the repo, run 'npm install' and then run 'start'. Or, you can just visit the demo page at https://ladymelven.github.io/burger-builder/
