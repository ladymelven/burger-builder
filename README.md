This is my study project from Maximilian Schwarzmueller's course on React and Redux. Only React so far (planning on adding Redux soon). Also planning to add authentification.

The app is a burger contructor where user can pick ingredients for a burger and then fill out a dilvery form to order it. It is SPA with routing, consists of the main page, checkout form and order history. The app is fully adaptive and supports all living browsers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In my code, I mostly followed the instructor, though the styling (CSS Modules) and some component implementations (e.g. form validation) are done differently.
